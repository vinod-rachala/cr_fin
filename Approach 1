Automatically discover joins between tables using machine learning and probabilistic reasoning, rather than relying on manual foreign keys.

Essentially:

For two given tables 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B, predict whether a column pair (or set of columns) forms a valid join relationship.

🧱 Framework (Derived from Both Pages)
1. Feature Extraction: Build Evidence from Data

You’re collecting multiple forms of evidence for a potential join.

a. Prior Evidence

Before looking at the actual data values, use:

Schema metadata (column types, unique constraints)

Column name similarity (e.g., “user_id” ↔ “id”)

Cardinality hints (unique vs non-unique)

This gives an initial “prior” belief 
𝑃
(
join
)
P(join).

b. Posterior Evidence

After examining the data values, update your belief using:

Overlap ratio (fraction of values in A that appear in B)

Mutual information between columns

Value distribution similarity

Mutual indexing (shared index-like properties between columns)

Posterior evidence gives 
𝑃
(
join
∣
data
)
P(join∣data).

The model therefore updates:

𝑃
(
join
∣
data
)
∝
𝑃
(
data
∣
join
)
×
𝑃
(
join
)
P(join∣data)∝P(data∣join)×P(join)

This Bayesian update is implicit in your notes where you wrote “prior evidence” and “posterior evidence.”

2. Mutual Indexing (Key Concept)

You mentioned “Mutual Indexing – Anand 2014”, which refers to an approach where two columns are compared based on:

How much their sorted orderings or indices correspond,

Or how much their unique value mappings align.

It’s a good metric for detecting key–foreign-key relationships even without explicit constraints.
This metric becomes part of your posterior evidence features.

3. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

From your second page:

“Principal Component Analysis (Fishman / Day / Anand–2014)”

You’re noting that PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or related methods can reduce the high-dimensional feature space of all evidence metrics (value overlaps, cardinalities, mutual info, etc.) into a few principal components representing the most informative dimensions.

That’s useful because the number of possible features grows quickly with all these metrics.

So the steps are:

Compute all features for each candidate join.

Apply PCA → compress correlated evidence metrics.

Use those components as inputs to a classifier or ranking model.

4. Machine Learning Layer

Now that you have prior and posterior features (possibly compressed with PCA):

Train a classifier to decide if a join is likely.

Typical algorithms:

Logistic Regression (interpretable)

Random Forest / XGBoost (robust)

Neural networks or RNN-MDP (as in your note) if you’re modeling sequences of joins in a workflow.

5. RNN–MDP Reference

Your second page says:

“RNN MDP – Model correlation – prior dependencies.”

This hints at a Markov Decision Process (MDP) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approach to model sequences of joins.
That is, not just individual join pairs, but how joins depend on one another in multi-table integration tasks.

Each state = current join context.

Action = next join decision.

Reward = improvement in match score or downstream query accuracy.

This can refine join predictions iteratively — learning from multi-join patterns (like joining fact and dimension tables in a star schema).

6. Ranking or Scoring (PageRank Analogy)

Your first page mentions Page Ranking at the top.
That suggests using a graph-based join ranking:

Tables are nodes.

Predicted joins are edges weighted by confidence.

Apply a PageRank-like algorithm to propagate confidence and highlight the most central or likely joins in the dataset graph.

This is particularly powerful when multiple tables share indirect relationships (A→B→C).

7. Decision Pipeline (Refined Summary)
Stage	Description	Techniques Used
1. Candidate Generation	Identify type-compatible column pairs	Schema analysis
2. Prior Evidence	Metadata + name-based likelihood	Type checks, name similarity
3. Posterior Evidence	Data-based measures	Mutual indexing, overlap, MI
4. Feature Compression	Reduce dimensionality	PCA
5. Classification / Scoring	Predict join likelihood	ML classifier (e.g., Logistic, RF)
6. Ranking	Rank joins globally	PageRank-like propagation
7. Sequential Optimization	Refine multi-join paths	RNN/MDP modeling
8. Output

A ranked list of joins (column pairs with probabilities).

Optionally, a join graph showing how all tables are related.

9. Optional Extension

Use Nearest Neighbor or Graph Embedding (PCA + kNN) to suggest similar joins in unseen tables.

Feed results into a query optimizer or data integration system.

🧠 Summary in Plain English

You’re proposing a hybrid system that:

Uses metadata (prior) and data overlap (posterior) to infer joins.

Quantifies relationships with mutual indexing and mutual information.

Compresses the evidence via PCA.

Trains a classifier or ranking model.

Optionally models multi-join chains via RNN/MDP.

Produces a ranked list of likely joins (like PageRank for data relationships).

Would you like me to illustrate this framework as a block diagram (showing how “prior evidence → posterior evidence → PCA → classifier → ranked joins” flows)?
That could make it much clearer for inclusion in a paper or presentation.
