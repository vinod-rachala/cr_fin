AI Platform â€“ Phase 1 / Day 1 Must-Have Capabilities
Core MLOps Foundation


Model registry, versioning, and experiment tracking


CI/CD pipelines for training and deployment (GitOps/ArgoCD/Terraform)


Automated packaging, promotion, and rollback


Support for both ML and LLM endpoints


Data Management & Feature Store (DataOps Base)


Secure data ingestion and validation


Central data catalog and lineage tracking


Initial feature store or dataset registry for reusability


Schema validation and basic data quality monitoring


Observability & Monitoring Setup


Logging (Loki / Cloud Logging), metrics (Prometheus / Cloud Monitoring), tracing (OpenTelemetry)


Model performance dashboards (latency, drift, accuracy)


Basic alerting and incident notifications


Security & Access Control


SSO / IAM integration (Okta / Azure AD / Cloud IAM)


Encryption at rest and in transit (KMS / CMEK)


Role-based access control (RBAC) for data, models, and pipelines


Secrets management (Vault / Secret Manager)


Governance & Compliance Foundations


Model and dataset documentation (model cards, metadata)


Approval workflow for production model deployment


Audit logging and evidence capture for SOC2/PCI readiness


PII/PHI handling guidelines and DLP integration


Initial FinOps & Resource Optimization


Budget monitoring and alerts


VM/GPU auto-parking or idle resource shutdown


Cost dashboards (per model / per project)


Tagging and labeling for chargeback and visibility


Developer & Data Scientist Enablement


Secure notebook environments (Vertex AI Workbench / SageMaker Studio / JupyterHub)


Standardized SDKs and CLI for experimentation and deployment


Internal documentation hub and reusable code templates


LLM Enablement (Controlled Start)


Prompt templates and basic evaluation setup


Integration with one provider (e.g., Bedrock or Vertex AI)


Guardrails for safety, content filtering, and prompt logging


Embedding store and simple RAG prototype


Infrastructure Automation & Deployment Backbone


Terraform for IaC and standardized environments


Kubernetes/EKS/GKE setup for scalable workloads


Secure networking (VPC, Private Service Connect, Service Mesh if needed)


CI/CD integration with Vault-based secrets


Roadmap & Platform Operating Model Definition


Define roles: Platform Ops, Data Ops, ML Ops, FinOps, SecOps


Establish review cadence (Estimation Council / Governance Board)


Create Phase 2 & 3 backlog (LLMOps maturity, Agentic AI, Multi-tenancy)


Document KPIs: reuse %, ROI, model SLA compliance
